Chatbot landing page using VueJs and an API (wit.ai)
============================

So, here is the beginning of the project: a landing page where you can see a demonstration of our product (the chatbot) and buy it. 

Visit the project : https://space-bot-guillaume-loic.herokuapp.com/

Getting started
----------------------------
You'll need some solid base on :

 - HTML5
 - CSS 3
 - Javascript
 - Fetch (for the API)
 - VueJs (optional)

---

## Vuejs3
Vue is a framework for JS, to install vue you can visit their official page https://vuejs.org/


Then you'll have to get familiar with the VueJs structure before trying to code anything.

## ChatBot

Our chatbot is powered by Wit.ai, a text-recognition learning bot developped by facebook.
